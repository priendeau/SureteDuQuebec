__description__ = u"""This structure is intended for the Public Access of Visual Information, to provide tools to
  accelerate search or enhance content into harmonic-identification of << dudits recherches >>...
=========
  This is provided by third non-private party's and is out of any remuneration form or contribution form
  to provide the information under false-reason, abussive form or gangsterism-form listed in Canada.

  This Tools is provided as-is and beleive in evolution of tools to provide accurate information to
  help our security systems being wiser...


  By the way, This tools will implement fast path drawing with conversion of image into wavelet path-definition,
  and being meshed with meshPy to provide structural rotation form and valid images deformation re-rendering in
  3d world....

  And All the information will be adapted to mahotas or a.k.a sub-branch of Montreal-Olympic-Stadium-kml-python
  with similar property of looking for mapped information and using a mesh it can discover a image with
  similar meshing, thru mahotas-> morph module...

  And tiny theorical system... Implanting FFVideo from _X-Devlpt ( FFVideo_test_image_wavelet_prg from VideoProject branch ),
  can explicitly convert reserched-subject into valid envirronment lookup if people are participating to
  "a Video Saga"... The result between if they are hiding because they are too shy or ashamedly dead or their
  video-show... It's not my domain...


Installing
==========
  Under Development.
  
  You can download the latest versions released from <<No pypi for the moment, crude develpt and 
  in correct stuff will cause problem and rejection, but maxistedeams will release it >>
  or download the development version straight from the mercurial repository hosted by me at:
  git://github.com/priendeau/SureteDuQuebec.git.

Documentation
=============
  Is currently lacking, about every method is documented in the source. But future prototype will
  become move and more verbosis and Final realse will include test-case and a lot of documentation.
