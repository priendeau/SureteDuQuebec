  This Tools is provided as-is and beleive in evolution of tools to provide accurate information to

  By the way, This tools will implement fast path drawing with conversion of image into wavelet path-definition,
  and being meshed with meshPy to provide structural rotation form and valid images deformation re-rendering in
  3d world....

  And All the information will be adapted to mahotas or a.k.a sub-branch of Montreal-Olympic-Stadium-kml-python
  with similar property of looking for mapped information and using a mesh it can discover a image with
  similar meshing, thru mahotas-> morph module...

  And tiny theorical system... Implanting FFVideo from _X-Devlpt ( FFVideo_test_image_wavelet_prg from VideoProject branch ),
  can explicitly convert reserched-subject into valid envirronment lookup if people are participating to
  "a Video Saga"... The result between if they are hiding because they are too shy or ashamedly dead or their
  video-show... It's not my domain...
